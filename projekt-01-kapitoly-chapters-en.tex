\chapter{Introduction}

Randomisation is essential to research areas such as \textit{probabilistic programming},~dependability (system components with uncertainty),~distributed computing (symmetry breaking),~and planning (unknown and noisy environments).
Probabilistic programs are powerful modelling apparatus of systems containing probabilistic uncertainty.
Systems with unreliable and unpredictable behaviour require the~use of such a~mathematical apparatus established on probability theory.
Designing such systems exhibiting a~desirable behaviour \,--\, e.g. selecting the~optimal power management strategy or a~network protocol increasing the~packet throughput \,--\, is challenging for reasoning over multiple alternative designs.
Their applications cover a~broad range of research areas,~including,~e.g. analysis of (quantitative) software product lines~\cite{spl1,spl2},~strategy synthesis in planning under partial observability~\cite{pomdp1,pomdp2},~or design of communication protocols~\cite{herman1,herman2}.

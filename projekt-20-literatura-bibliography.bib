abstract = { We present Prophet, a novel patch generation system that works with a set of successful human patches obtained from open- source software repositories to learn a probabilistic, application-independent model of correct code. It generates a space of candidate patches, uses the model to rank the candidate patches in order of likely correctness, and validates the ranked patches against a suite of test cases to find correct patches. Experimental results show that, on a benchmark set of 69 real-world defects drawn from eight open-source projects, Prophet significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art patch generation system. },

abstract = {Sketching is a software synthesis approach where the programmer develops a partial implementation - a sketch - and a separate specification of the desired functionality. The synthesizer then completes the sketch to behave like the specification. The correctness of the synthesized implementation is guaranteed by the compiler, which allows, among other benefits, rapid development of highly tuned implementations without the fear of introducing bugs.We develop SKETCH, a language for finite programs with linguistic support for sketching. Finite programs include many highperformance kernels, including cryptocodes. In contrast to prior synthesizers, which had to be equipped with domain-specific rules, SKETCH completes sketches by means of a combinatorial search based on generalized boolean satisfiability. Consequently, our combinatorial synthesizer is complete for the class of finite programs: it is guaranteed to complete any sketch in theory, and in practice has scaled to realistic programming problems.Freed from domain rules, we can now write sketches as simpleto-understand partial programs, which are regular programs in which difficult code fragments are replaced with holes to be filled by the synthesizer. Holes may stand for index expressions, lookup tables, or bitmasks, but the programmer can easily define new kinds of holes using a single versatile synthesis operator.We have used SKETCH to synthesize an efficient implementation of the AES cipher standard. The synthesizer produces the most complex part of the implementation and runs in about an hour.},

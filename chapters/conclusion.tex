\section{Conclusions}
In this thesis,~we considered the~problem of automated synthesis of probabilistic systems.
We designed and implemented support for \emph{multi-property} specifications and \emph{optimal} synthesis within all oracles \,--\, CEGIS, AR and especially Hybrid.
We evaluated the~performance of these advanced methods to synthesise probabilistic programs on the~various benchmarks.
Performed experiments on practically relevant benchmarks demonstrated that a~\textit{novel integrated} synthesis algorithm retains proven performance comparing to state-of-the-art synthesis approaches.
Further,~we designed a~method to perform \emph{combined} probabilistic synthesis consisting of both \emph{topology} and \emph{parameter} synthesis.
We demonstrated the~performance of this method for various real-world case studies and proved its correct functionality concerning the~requirements.
All these designed methods supporting various synthesis tasks were integrated within the~tool \toolname{},~which was also introduced.
Additionally,~\toolname{} is the~first tool that supports the~combined synthesis,~including unknown topology as well as transition probabilities.

Our tool paper presenting PAYNT has been recently accepted at CAV'21,~an~A* conference.
Moreover,~we presented \toolname{} also at the~students' conference Excel@FIT'21,~where we got the award from the~expert panel to develop of the~tool that significantly expands the~possibilities of designing probabilistic systems.
At this conference,~we also won an~award from the~professional public.
